# seqaln_tools
Different python libraries that automate downloading, filtering and analysis of sequences and sequence alignments.
Dig here if you want to know how:
- Download seqeunces from NCBI databases and filter them.
- Display a multiple sequence alignment using TexShade and python wrapper.
- Example scripts of doing homology modeling with Modeller including converting MSA fromats to PIR format.
- Map sequences or there features to a taxonomic tree through ete2
- Calculate mutual information between two sequences.
- Make dataplots on top of seqeunces or sequence alignments.
- Find and display secondary structure elements in sequences.
